## Technical Assignment: Pokémon Personality Profiler

### Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to enhance the existing repository by implementing additional features using Nuxt.js and integrating the OpenAI API. The task involves enabling users to manage their Pokémon collection within a "Pokeball store" and utilizing the OpenAI API to provide personalized insights based on the Pokémon in their collection.

### Tasks:

1. **Fork Repository:**
   - Fork the provided repository: [https://github.com/spend-cloud-tom/technical-assessment-husny](https://github.com/spend-cloud-tom/technical-assessment-husny).

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
   - Run the development server using `pnpm run dev`.

3. **Implement Pokémon Overview:**
   - Create a page for displaying an overview of Pokémon.
   - Fetch Pokémon data from an API (e.g., [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)) and display it on the page.

4. **Pokeball Store:**
   - Implement functionality to add Pokémon to the "Pokeball store."
   - Allow users to store a maximum of 6 Pokémon in their Pokeball store.
   - Implement validation to prevent adding more than 6 Pokémon.

5. **OpenAI API Integration:**
   - Acquire API keys for the OpenAI API (ensure they are kept secure).
   - Utilize the OpenAI API to generate insights about a user's personality based on the Pokémon in their Pokeball store.
   - Design and implement a mechanism to process the Pokémon data and generate meaningful insights using the OpenAI API.

### Deliverables:

1. **Pull Request:**
   - Submit a pull request to the original repository containing your changes.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Document any setup instructions or additional steps necessary to run the application.
   - Provide an overview of the implemented features and how to interact with them.

3. **API Keys:**
   - Provide instructions for obtaining and using the API keys required for the OpenAI API integration.
