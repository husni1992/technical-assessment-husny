## Technical Assignment: Pokémon Personality Profiler

### Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to enhance the existing repository by implementing additional features using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and integrating the OpenAI API. The task involves enabling users to manage their Pokémon collection within a "Pokeball store" and utilizing the OpenAI API to provide personalized insights based on the Pokémon in their collection.

### Tasks:

1. **Fork Repository:**
   - Fork the provided repository: [https://github.com/spend-cloud-tom/technical-assessment-husny](https://github.com/spend-cloud-tom/technical-assessment-husny).

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
   - Run the development server using `pnpm run dev`.

3. **Implement Pokémon Overview:**
   - Create a page for displaying an overview of Pokémon.
   - Fetch Pokémon data from an API (e.g., [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)) and display it on the page.

4. **Pokeball Store:**
   - Implement functionality to add Pokémon to the "Pokeball store."
   - Allow users to store a maximum of 6 Pokémon in their Pokeball store.
   - Implement validation to prevent adding more than 6 Pokémon.

5. **OpenAI API Integration:**
   - Acquire API keys for the OpenAI API (ensure they are kept secure).
   - Utilize the OpenAI API to generate insights about a user's personality based on the Pokémon in their Pokeball store.
   - Design and implement a mechanism to process the Pokémon data and generate meaningful insights using the OpenAI API: tell the user something about themselves based on the Pokémon they have collected.

6. **UI/UX Enhancements:**
   - Determine the best ways to show the additional features and data on the existing pages. This doesn't need to be overly complex, but should be a bit user-friendly.

### Deliverables:

1. **Fork:**
   - Submit a repository that is a fork of the provided repository with the implemented features.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Document any setup instructions or additional steps necessary to run the application.
   - Provide an overview of the implemented features and how to interact with them.

3. **API Keys:**
   - Provide instructions for obtaining and using the API keys required for the OpenAI API integration.

### Deadline:
The assignment should be completed within **14 days** of receiving this document.
